> # NOTES
>
> - **Use a food processor for the garlic and ginger.** Using a food processor grind the garlic and ginger so quickly and minces it to the finest texture you want for these wings.
> - **To prevent sticking, spray the grill with vegetable oil.** This prevents the skin of the chicken from sticking to the grill.
> - **Cook the wings low and slow.** This guarantees a juicy cooked wing that you can control how quickly it cooks.
> - **Keep one burner off in case some wings are cooked quicker.** Move the wings that are cooked quicker over the cooler burner to prevent them from burning.
> - **Storage Instructions:** You can store these Korean Gochujang chicken wings in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
