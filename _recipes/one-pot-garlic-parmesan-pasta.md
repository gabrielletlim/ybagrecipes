> Stir in chicken broth, milk and fettuccine; season with salt and pepper, to taste.

---

> Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until pasta is cooked through, about 18-20 minutes. Stir in Parmesan. If the mixture is too thick, add more milk as needed until desired consistency is reached.
